                Budgeting Buddy is your go-to tool for managing your finances in a way that's simple, efficient, and even fun. 
                With so many budgeting methods out there, it's easy to make mistakes or feel overwhelmed — that's where Budgeting Buddy comes in. 
                It is here to help you stay on track and make smart financial decisions.
            </p>
            <h1 class="home-title">Dashboard</h1>
            <p class="home-text">
                Think of the dashboard as your financial home base. Here, you'll enter your current balance and input your income and expenses.
                This section powers the rest of the app — the budget and savings features rely on this data to help you plan for success.
            </p>
            <h1 class="home-title">Budget</h1>
            <p class="home-text">
                The budget section is your path to saving smarter. Choose from proven budgeting templates used by thousands, or customize your own
                plan that fits your lifestyle. Whether you're a beginner or a budgeting pro, this section gives you full control.
            </p>
            <h1 class="home-title">Savings</h1>
            <p class="home-text">
                The savings section is short and sweet — but powerful. Based on the income and expenses you entered in the dashboard, you'll get a 
                clear visual of how your finances can grow over time. Use it to set savings goals, track progress, and improve your strategy for
                long-term success.
